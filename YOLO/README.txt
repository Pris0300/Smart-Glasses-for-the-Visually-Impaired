YOLO file
This file is used to understand how to use the main features from a ML model to detect objects in a real time video.
Some of the features to notice that will be needed in the final ML model:
- Import a pretrained model
- Read a pre recorded video file or a real time video frame by frame 
- Show the bounding boxes in the final video (And store where the objects are in the image)
- Use a special key to exit the program

To use this code, it is needed to download all the files from this directory and in the main code there's a terminal line to how to run the code. For this you need to change the directory of the terminal where you have all these files stored.
