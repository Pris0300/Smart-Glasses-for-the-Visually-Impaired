# Smart-Glasses-for-the-Visually-Impaired
This project leverages Vuzix Blade smart glasses to capture real-time video input for object detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained using Federated Learning and processed in the cloud to assist visually impaired users by detecting nearby obstacles and locating objects.
