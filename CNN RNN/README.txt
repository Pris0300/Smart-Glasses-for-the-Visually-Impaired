Models file
This files  contains both of the models that the team design. 
- Networks: contain both of the models structures and training. This file saves each model and shows the plots of perfomance. To run it, can be on a code editor as VSCode, or from the terminal using "python networks.py".
- detection: contains the tests for reading the models in a external file to use them in a real time detector. IT MAY NOT WORK. To run it, you'll need the .pd and .pbtxt files that the networks.py file makes.
